We reserve the right to conduct an oral exam after the exam, e.g. when we are correcting the exam. If you are subject to the oral exam, you will need to describe your code, what it does and why you chose to solve the question(s) the way you did. This will test your skills in using the tools introduced in the course and involves live coding in an RStudio environment with internet access. Here is some further information

1. There will be four questions, at least one of them will be from the class questions listed below.
2. The exam will be available on Github on the 22/12 12:00 which you will then download (however you choose to). 
3. **You hand in your exam answers (code and accompanying text) by mailing your .Rmd containing text and your solutions to the questions to my (Erik) email. It is on the course webpage.**
